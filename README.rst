raytraverse is a complete workflow for climate based daylight modelling,
simulation, and evaluation of architectural spaces. Built around a wavelet
guided adaptive sampling strategy, raytraverse can fully explore the daylight
conditions throughout a space with efficient use of processing power and
storage space.

Usage
-----
raytraverse includes a complete command line interface with all commands
nested under the `raytraverse` parent command enter::

    raytraverse --help

raytraverse also exposes an object oriented API written primarily in python.
calls to Radiance are made through Renderer objects that wrap the radiance
c source code in c++ classes, which are made available in python with pybind11.
see the src/ directory for more.

For complete documentation of the API and the command line interface either
use the Documentation link included above or::

    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    make docs

to generate local documentation.
